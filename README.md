# dotfiles

This repository contains the dotfiles that I use.

# Usage

You will need to have the [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) utility
installed.

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/kioku/dotfiles.git
    env RCRC=$HOME/dotfiles/rcrc rcup

You will need to install the vim plugins afterwards, so open up a vim instance
and run :PlugInstall
